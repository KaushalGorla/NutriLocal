🎯 Core MVP (Lean Build)

Problem:

Local restaurants struggle to attract customers who are health-conscious.

Customers struggle to find affordable meals aligned with nutrition goals (calories, protein, etc.).

Solution (MVP):

A mobile app where users input simple goals (calories/day, protein target, budget).

The app suggests meal options from nearby local businesses that fit both nutrition and cost.

Simple interface: Profile setup → Recommendations list → Order link (or “visit” info).

MVP Features:

User profile (diet goals + budget).

Local restaurant menu scraping or manual input.

Algorithm: Match user goals ↔ menu items (filter + recommend).

Basic nutrition breakdown + price per meal.

Map view of local businesses.

🌱 Social Good Additions

To move beyond just “personal fitness,” make it community-focused & philanthropic:

Support Local Economy

Prioritize small/local restaurants over chains to funnel money into the community.

Highlight minority-owned, women-owned, or family-owned businesses.

Healthy + Affordable Access

Show budget-friendly nutritious meals → useful for students, low-income users, or food deserts.

Partner with local nonprofits to include discount vouchers or subsidies.

Food Waste Reduction

Businesses can list end-of-day surplus meals at discount (healthy + reduces waste).

Users get affordable options → restaurants don’t throw food away.

Community Nutrition Goals

Users can “team up” with friends or neighborhoods to reach collective nutrition challenges (e.g., “Our town hit 10,000g of protein this week!”).

Gamification = more engagement.

Charitable Tie-In

For every meal plan purchased, the business can donate a small portion to a local food bank.

Or users can round up orders to support local hunger relief.
